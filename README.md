# My React TypeScript App

This project is a basic React application built with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool and Vitest for testing.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-react-ts-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the Vite development server, and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
